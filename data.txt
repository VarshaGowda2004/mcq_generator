In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from:

An input layer (yellow)
A hidden layer (blue)
An output layer (red)
In the Neural Network Model, input data (yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (blue) before producing the final output (red).

The First Layer:
The yellow perceptrons are making simple decisions based on the input. Each single decision is sent to the perceptrons in the next layer.

The Second Layer:
The blue perceptrons are making decisions by weighing the results from the first layer. This layer make more complex decisions at a more abstract level than the first layer.
